## Installation and Dependencies

Each directory has a requirements.txt describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

pip
To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue pip3 install -r requirements.txt.

If there is no a requirements.txt file, it means there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
The code in that case should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
This repository contains files related to Data Scientist Nanodegree Program - Convolutional Neural Networks [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).

## Topics
This repository containts tutorial notebooks and implementagtions for various deep learning topics.
* Gradient descent: Implements the basic functions of the Gradient Descent algorithm to find the boundary in a small dataset.
